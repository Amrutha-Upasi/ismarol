INTRODUCTION
------------

The Floating Social Icons module allows sites to display social icons and links
to other social sites. This module does not use javascript, it uses twig if else
conditions to set classes based on condition. This module does not share,
instead it directs to the URL of the social site.

 * For a full description of the module visit:
   https://www.drupal.org/project/floating_social_icons

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.

The Floating Social Icons module uses Font Awesome Method SVG with js instead of
webfonts.
